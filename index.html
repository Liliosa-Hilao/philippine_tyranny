Witnesses reported that she was subjected to brutal treatment, including torture and sexual abuse, while in custody at Camp Crame. The official narrative claimed she committed suicide, but this was widely disputed.  The circumstances surrounding her death strongly suggest she was a victim of state-sponsored violence.</p>
