    <h1>Liliosa Hilao: A Martyr of Martial Law</h1>

    <p>In this Philippine name, the middle name or maternal family name is Rapi and the surname or paternal family name is Hilao.</p>

    <p>Liliosa Rapi Hilao (March 14, 1950 â€“ April 5, 1973) was a Filipina student journalist and activist who became a symbol of resistance against the oppressive rule of Martial Law in the Philippines. She is remembered as the first prisoner to die in detention during martial law in the Philippines. She was a student of Communication Arts at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.</p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Liliosa Hilao was born on March 14, 1950, in Bulan, Sorsogon, Philippines. She was the seventh of nine children, having seven sisters and one brother.  Liliosa was a consistent honor student in elementary and high school.</p>

    <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
    <p>At the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM), Liliosa was actively involved in various organizations. She was an editor for the university paper *Hasik*, the student president of the communication arts department, a representative to PLM's student central government, secretary of the Women's Club of Pamantasan, and a member of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines.  She even formed the Communication Arts Club.  Although she was known to be sickly and did not participate in student protests, she expressed her opinions through her writing for *Hasik*.  Her articles, including "The Vietnamization of the Philippines" and "Democracy is Dead in the Philippines under Martial Law," demonstrated her stance against Martial Law.</p>

    <h2>Arrest and Death</h2>

    <h3>Arrest of Liliosa</h3>
    <p>On April 4, 1973, the Philippine Constabulary raided the Hilao residence. The soldiers identified themselves as members of the Philippine Constabulary Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU), led by Lt. Arturo Castillo.  According to an official letter from the Hilao family, the CANU soldiers presented only a Philippine Constabulary identification card and no warrant or search order. Liliosa was not home during the initial raid but arrived later that evening. Upon her arrival, Lt. Castillo subjected her to extreme violence, repeatedly beating her. Family members were prevented from intervening due to threats from the soldiers. On the morning of April 5, 1973, Liliosa was handcuffed and taken to the CANU office at Camp Crame for questioning.</p>

    <h3>Arrest of Josefina</h3>
    <p>Liliosa's sister, Josefina, was also arrested and taken to Camp Crame. Josefina saw Liliosa but was not allowed to speak to her.  Josefina noticed that parts of Liliosa's face were beaten and bloodied, indicating torture and abuse.</p>

    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>On April 7, 1973, three days after Liliosa's arrest, her sister, Alice Hilao Gualberto, received a phone call informing her that Liliosa was in critical condition at the Camp Crame Station Hospital due to serious injuries.  Alice found Liliosa in the emergency room. Her face was disfigured, and her body had numerous injuries and bruises, including needle puncture marks on her left arm and forearm, and "an opening at her throat." The medical equipment was not functioning correctly, and no medical staff was attending to her.  The room smelled strongly of formalin, according to the family's letter.  Alice was only able to see Liliosa briefly before being taken to the CANU office where she met Josefina.  Lt. Castillo then informed them that Liliosa had died. The Philippine Constabulary Crime Laboratory's necropsy report listed cardio-respiratory arrest as the cause of death. The Constabulary offered the Hilao family 2,200 pesos for burial expenses, which the family refused.</p>

    <p>Liliosa was a candidate for cum laude honors before her death.  At the graduation ceremony, a seat was left vacant for her, and she was posthumously awarded her degree cum laude.</p>

    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>Authorities claimed Liliosa committed suicide by drinking muriatic acid and declared the case closed.  However, her family and friends did not believe that the military was uninvolved in her death. After the People Power Revolution in 1986, several lawsuits were filed against President Marcos for torture, including one filed by a relative of Liliosa Hilao, alleging that she was killed after being "beaten, raped, and scarred by muriatic acid."  This case was the first in the United States to bring a former president of another country to trial, based on the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.  In 1986, the court initially dismissed the case, citing the "act of state doctrine." The Philippine government filed a brief of amicus curiae, urging the US courts to exercise jurisdiction.  The government provided documents, including updates on executions and torture that Marcos received, to counter claims that officials were unaware of the human rights abuses. In 1996, the Court of Appeals in Southern California ruled in favor of the Hilao family, awarding nearly $2 billion in damages to almost 10,000 human rights victims.  However, the Marcos family concealed their assets through dummy corporations, making it difficult to collect the full amount.</p>

    <p>The legitimacy of these court cases within the US judicial system remains a subject of debate.  Furthermore, the independence of the Philippine Supreme Court during the Marcos regime is questionable.  Scholars like Tate and Haynie have suggested that Marcos held significant influence over the court, potentially compromising its impartiality.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>During the 1980s, activists sought to replace traditional Filipino women role models. They championed women revolutionaries and activists who fought against the Marcos regime.  Rejecting the idea that women should accept a "life of suffering," they promoted new ideals, such as "Hindi kailangan magtiis" ("It is not necessary to endure") and "Know yourself, trust yourself, respect yourself."  Traditional stereotypes like Maria Clara, Sisa, and Juli were challenged, and women like Liliosa Hilao, who fought for justice and human rights, were held up as new role models.</p>

    <p>Liliosa Hilao's name is inscribed on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani's Wall of Remembrance. A street in her hometown of Bulan, Sorsogon, is also named after her.</p>
